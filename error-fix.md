# Error Fixes for Mr. System Website

## Issues Fixed

1. **TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'querySelector')**
   - Fixed in `navigation-upgrade.js` by removing the problematic `resetScrollPosition` function
   - Added safety checks before accessing DOM elements

2. **TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'querySelector')**
   - Fixed in `scroll-progress.js` by adding null checks for all DOM elements
   - Added early returns when elements don't exist

3. **Failed to load resource: 404 (Not Found)**
   - This error might be related to missing image files referenced in the HTML
   - The website functionality should work despite this error

## Implementation Changes

1. **Simplified Navigation Code**
   - Removed complex functions that were causing errors
   - Maintained core functionality while improving stability

2. **Added Safety Checks**
   - All DOM operations now check if elements exist before accessing them
   - Prevents JavaScript errors when elements are missing

3. **Optimized Event Listeners**
   - Using passive event listeners where possible for better performance
   - Reduced unnecessary event handler complexity

## Testing

After implementing these fixes, please test the following functionality:

1. Navigation between sections using:
   - Menu links
   - Scroll wheel
   - Touch swipes on mobile
   - Section indicators

2. Scroll behavior within scrollable sections

3. Progress bar functionality

If any issues persist, please provide the specific error messages for further troubleshooting.
